# Facial Emotion Recognition Using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based facial emotion recognition system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python with Keras and OpenCV. It can classify human emotions from facial expressions in real-time into seven categories:

- 😄 Happy
- 😐 Neutral
- 😢 Sad
- 😠 Angry
- 😲 Surprised
- 🤢 Disgust
- 😨 Fear
